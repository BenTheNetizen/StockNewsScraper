# StockNewsScraper
This program takes a given stock ticker or stock name and returns the most recent, relevant news articles through an RSS feed using Python.

When keeping up with the financial markets and economic news, it can be difficult and a nuisance to gather relevant articles by Googling various search queries. Created using Python's feedparser library, StockNewsScraper seeks to eliminate this inconvenience by sourcing stock news articles in one place. The output from StockNewsScraper is formatted by article title followed by the date published and url to the full article.
